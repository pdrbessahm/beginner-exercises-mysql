# MySQL Beginner Exercises  

This repository contains my practice exercises while learning **MySQL**.  
Each exercise is saved as a separate `.sql` file, making it easy to track progress and revisit concepts.  

## 📂 Structure
- `01_create_database.sql` → Create a database  
- `02_create_table.sql` → Create the `employees` table  
- `03_populating_table.sql` → Insert sample employee data  
- `04_select_age.sql` → Select employees older than 30  
- `05_update_column.sql` → Update salary of employee with id=3  
- `06_deleting_data.sql` → Delete employee named "John"  
- `07_get_the_average.sql` → Calculate average salary  
- `08_max_salary.sql` → Find maximum salary in IT department  
- `09_count_and_group_by.sql` → Count employees per department  
- `10_order_by_salary.sql` → List employees by descending salary  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add **More beginner exercises** (since I need to practice a lot more)
- Add **Intermediate exercises** (joins, grouping with conditions, subqueries).  
- Add **Advanced exercises** (views, triggers, stored procedures).  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench  
- Git + GitHub for version control
